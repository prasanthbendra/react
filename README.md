As part of the Strategic Client Onboarding End to End Analysis, the Target State Vision was defined for an efficient and intuitive Client Onboarding experience that enables advisors with insights and opportunities to acquire new clients and assets. The Target State includes a key fundamental shift – encouraging field users to start capturing profile data about the prospect during the client acquisition process, which enables users to benefit from CRM capabilities as well as streamline the subsequent account opening process. 

This document includes the requirements to transform and streamline the New Account Opening (NAO) process while integrating it into 3D, where the user can leverage client and account data in context to further simplify account opening. This project builds upon the foundation provided by the WebNAS to 3D Integration View/Edit project, which enabled all WebNAS data to be displayed and edited in the 3D Profile.

The redesigned account opening process was constructed to support future enhancements to further digitize the process – such as interactive and mobile data collection methods, linking to prospect goals and financial plans, shifting to paperless processes, and profile analytics to support promotion of relevant products and features. Moving forward, Goals Based interactions will be considered a critical element of the client experience during Client Onboarding and will be integrated in the account opening process accordingly. 

Additionally, this project supports the shift towards the Client-Centric platform strategy, making it easier for advisors to holistically service their clients and improving efficiency of downstream processes. This project includes party-centric management of ancillary individuals and positions the platform for future opportunities such as client-level documents, approvals and EDD.
